Hello their (^ _^)/
    here are a couple notes about my submission
        - if you don't want to see all the images coming up, and the text
        coming up and what to obtain the raw time of my algorithm. Hop
        inside Image.py and change debug to True

        - if you want to see the kind of results I got from the trainning images
        run this command which is going to run the test unit of the provided
        trainning data from blackboard

            python3 -m unittest test_image

        -if the trainning data is different to the one which you have provided
        us on blackboard, you will need to delte the binary files with the names
        kNN_classfy, and kNN_lables so the algorithm can create new versions
        of these files to clasfy

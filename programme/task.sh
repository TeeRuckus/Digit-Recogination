Hello their (^ _^)/
    here are a couple notes about my submission
        - if you want to see what the algorithms are doing at each stage i.e.
        see how it's filtering out the bounding boxes. Hop inside the Image.py
        file and change debug from False to True

        - if you want to see the kind of results I got from the trainning images
        run this command which is going to run the test unit of the provided
        trainning data from blackboard

        -if the trainning data is different to the one which you have provided
        us on blackboard, you will need to delte the binary files with the names
        kNN_classfie, and kNN_lables so the algorithm can create new versions
        of these files
